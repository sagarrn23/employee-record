I developed this project to learn the React. Created the Complete CRUD application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps to try this app
1) Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/sagarrn23/employee-record.git
2) cd employee-record
3) npm install
4) npm start

For the CRUD functionality I have used the JSON Server. You can find the info here:- https://github.com/typicode/json-server
